 * Interface for receiving notification events about ServletRequest attribute changes.

 * Notifications will be generated while the request is within the scope of the web application. A ServletRequest is
 * defined as coming into scope of a web application when it is about to enter the first servlet or filter of the web
 * application, and as going out of scope when it exits the last servlet or the first filter in the chain.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to receive these notification events, the implementation class must be either declared in the deployment
 * descriptor of the web application, annotated with {@link jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebListener}, or registered via
 * one of the addListener methods defined on {@link ServletContext}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The order in which implementations of this interface are invoked is unspecified.
