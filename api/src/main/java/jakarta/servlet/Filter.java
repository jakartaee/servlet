/**
 * <p>
 * A filter is an object that performs filtering tasks on either the request to a resource (a servlet or static
 * content), or on the response from a resource, or both.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Filters perform filtering in the <code>doFilter</code> method. Every Filter has access to a FilterConfig object from
 * which it can obtain its initialization parameters, and a reference to the ServletContext which it can use, for
 * example, to load resources needed for filtering tasks.
 *
 * <p>
 * Filters are configured in the deployment descriptor of a web application.
 *
 * <p>
 * Examples that have been identified for this design are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Authentication Filters
 * <li>Logging and Auditing Filters
 * <li>Image conversion Filters
 * <li>Data compression Filters
 * <li>Encryption Filters
 * <li>Tokenizing Filters
 * <li>Filters that trigger resource access events
 * <li>XSL/T filters
 * <li>Mime-type chain Filter
 * </ol>

     * (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>),
