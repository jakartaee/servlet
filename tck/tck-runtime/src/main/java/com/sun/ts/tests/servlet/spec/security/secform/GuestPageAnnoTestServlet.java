 * This servlet is the annotation based equivalent of GuestPageTestServlet.
 * As such this declares roles, and specifies that the GET and POST methods
 * can be accessed by all of the declared roles.
 * 
 * This annotation based version of GuestPageTestServlet varies a bit from
 * it because GuestPageTestServlet specifies that GET and POST can be accessed
 * by "Administrator", "Manager", "VP"  *but* all other http methods
 * are left unprotected and so can be accessed by anyone.
 * This servlet specifies that *all* http methods can be accessed by 
 * "Administrator", "Manager", "Employee" (including GET and POST) and NO
 * http methods are left unprotected.  Thus, this servlet is trying to 
 * be more secure yet it still leaves GET & POST accessible to all declared
 * roles just as is done with GuestPageTestServlet.
